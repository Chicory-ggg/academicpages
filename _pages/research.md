## Integrated and Fine-grained Traffic Forecasting for Road Segments and Intersection Turns

- Define a *Heterogeneous Road network Graph (HRG)* to comprehensively represent the topological structure of the complete traffic network, incorporating different types of nodes and edges to depict roads and turns, as well as their synergistic relationships.
- Develope a *Heterogeneous Spatial Embedding (HSE)* module to characterize the heterogeneous road network information from attributes, significance, and relevance. Leveraging HSE, spatial transformer can effectively explore the intricate spatial correlations.
- Propose an *Adaptive Soft Threshold (AST)* module to alleviate the influence of high temporal fluctuation. Integrated with the AST, the proposed temporal transformer enhanced its capacity to capture complex temporal correlations in the presence of noise.
