## Integrated and Fine-grained Traffic Forecasting for Road Segments and Intersection Turns

- Define a *Heterogeneous Road network Graph (HRG)* to comprehensively represent the topological structure of the complete traffic network, incorporating different types of nodes and edges to depict roads and turns, as well as their synergistic relationships.
- Develope a *Heterogeneous Spatial Embedding (HSE)* module to characterize the heterogeneous road network information from attributes, significance, and relevance. Leveraging HSE, *Spatial Transformer (SpaFormer)* can effectively explore the intricate spatial correlations.
- Propose an *Adaptive Soft Threshold (AST)* module to alleviate the influence of high temporal fluctuation. Integrated with the AST, the proposed *Temporal Transformer (TempFormer)* enhanced its capacity to capture complex temporal correlations in the presence of noise.

## Complex Urban Traffic Forecasting based on Graph Representation and Deep Learning

- Propose significance encoding and relevancy encoding to compensate the attention mechanismâ€™s deficiency in complex road network representation, characterizing urban traffic networks from local and global perspectives.
- Develop a spatial attention to uncover the relationship between any pair of roads, dynamically modeling the geo-parcel-based traffic pattern correlations that do not depend on the road network.
- Design a multi-scale residual perception (MRP) based on shortcut connections to reconcile the competing influences of long-term periodicity and short-term variability, placing an emphasis on the fluctuating traffic states.
