Here is **Guangyue Li (栗广岳)**.
I'm a second year graduate student from [State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping and Remote Sensing](http://www.lmars.whu.edu.cn/en), [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn/). I am extremely fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Luliang Tang](http://jszy.whu.edu.cn/tangluliang). My primary research interest includes *Spatio-temporal Data Mining*, *Smart City*, *Deep Learning*, and *GeoAI*.

You can find my CV here: [Guangyue Li's Curriculum Vitae](../homepage/files/paper1.pdf).
